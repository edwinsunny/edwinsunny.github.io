                            <p class="card-text">Specialist is an app that offers every kind of expert professional whenever a person is in need. <br>
                                Nowadays finding a skilled specialist when needed is very tough. 
                                For example, when my pipe got broken and water is splashing everywhere 
                                I don’t know what to do in that situation, or my car is not starting suddenly in the morning, 
                                my PC starts to act strange, etcetera. Even if we find anyone it would be really costly. 
                                This app is trying to solve this issue by bringing various specialists under one umbrella cost-efficiently. You can find different experts like Plumber, Mechanic, Car washers, Maid, Baby Sitters, Computer technicians, Electricity technicians, etcetera in a single app.
